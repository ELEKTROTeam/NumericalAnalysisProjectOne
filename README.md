# Numerical Analysis First Project

This repository contains two machine learning models implemented entirely from scratch using **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**:

1. **Multiclass Logistic Regression**
2. **Multivariate Linear Regression**

Both are applied to real-world datasets and developed in **Jupyter Notebooks** as part of a Numerical Analysis university project.

## Live Demo (Gradio)

We also deployed a simplified version of both models:
